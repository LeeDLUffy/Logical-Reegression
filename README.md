# Logical-Reegression
To predict customer churn using the bank churn data, we can follow the below steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Check for missing values

Analyze distribution of target variable (Exited)

Analyze the distribution of other features and their relationship with the target variable

Logistic Regression:

Prepare the data for modeling by encoding categorical variables, splitting into training and testing datasets, etc.

Fit a logistic regression model to the training data

Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data

Analyze the model's coefficients to understand the feature importance in predicting churn.
