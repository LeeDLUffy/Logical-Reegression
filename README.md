# Logical-Reegression
To predict customer churn using the bank churn data, we can follow the below steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Load the churn dataset into the pandas dataframe

Explore the dataset by checking its dimensions, data types, missing values, and summary statistics.


Visualize the distribution of the target variable and explore its relationship with other variables using histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.


Check for outliers, anomalies, and data quality issues.


Transform and preprocess the data as needed (e.g., scaling, encoding categorical variables, imputing missing values).


Logistic Regression:

Split the data into training and testing sets.


Train a logistic regression model using the training data.


Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on the testing data.


Interpret the model's coefficients to gain insights into the relationship between the target variable and the predictor variables.


Tune the model's hyperparameters if needed to improve its performance.


Validate the model's generalization performance using cross-validation or holdout validation.


Draw conclusions and make predictions on new data using the trained model.

In this code the following steps were followed to obtain an analysis of the dataset using logical regression:

-First i prepared the data for modeling

-Encoding categorical variables

-Splitting the data into training and testing datasets

-Fitting a logistic regression model

-Predicting on the testing data

-Evaluating the model's performance

-Lastly analyzing the model's coefficients
